# tech-stack.local (pi extension flavor)

Primary lane:

- `tech-stack-core show pi-ts --prefer-repo`

Repo-local emphasis:

- Runtime/package manager baseline: Node.js 22 + npm (not Bun-first defaults).
- Release baseline: release-please + `npm run release:check` + npm trusted publishing.
- Keep package artifacts deterministic via `package.json` `files` allowlist.
- Lint/format baseline: Biome config in `biome.jsonc` + pinned local `@biomejs/biome` dev dependency.
- Biome path strategy: lint repo files by default, but exclude artifact/vendor buckets (`external/`, `ontology/`, build outputs, generated/minified files).
- Quality lane gate: `npm run quality:pre-commit`, `npm run quality:pre-push`, `npm run quality:ci`.
- Auto-fix workflow: `npm run fix` (before commit or when applying AI-generated diffs).
- Pin lane metadata in `policy/stack-lane.json` (`lane: ts`, pinned `tech_stack_core.ref`).
- Validate structural/docs invariants with `npm run check`.
