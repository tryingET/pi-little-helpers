# Support

## Before opening an issue

1. Read [README.md](README.md) and relevant docs in `docs/`.
2. Search existing issues/PRs for duplicates.
3. Re-test on the latest release.

## Open the right issue type

Use the GitHub issue forms for:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation improvements

## Security reports

For vulnerabilities, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and use private reporting.
Do **not** post exploit details in public issues.

## Maintainer response expectations

This project may be maintained part-time. Triage and response times can vary,
but actionable reports with reproduction details are prioritized.
